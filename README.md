# SunShade üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Salala


### Team Members

### Project Description
SunShade is an interactive web app that uses GPS or manual input to detect your travel direction and time of day, then recommends the best side to sit on a bus to avoid direct sunlight. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever had a hard time finding the shadiest seat on a bus to stay cool under the hot sun? Most people probably haven't faced that issue. Still, why not take a moment to address this "urgent" problem?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
SunShade tells you which side of the bus to sit on based on your travel direction and time. This helps you avoid sunburn and look cool.
