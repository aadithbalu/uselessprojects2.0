## Basic Details
### Team Name: Salala

### Project Description
SunShade is an interactive web app that uses GPS or manual input to detect your travel direction and time of day, then recommends the best side to sit on a bus to avoid direct sunlight. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever had a hard time finding the shadiest seat on a bus to stay cool under the hot sun? Most people probably haven't faced that issue. Still, why not take a moment to address this "urgent" problem?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
SunShade tells you which side of the bus to sit on based on your travel direction and time. This helps you avoid sunburn and look cool.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks/Libraries: None
- Tools: Google Fonts (Poppins), Browser Geolocation API


For Hardware:
- Any device with a GPS-enabled browser (smartphone, tablet, laptop)


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
No installations needed

# Run
Open sample.html in your browser and grant location access for automatic direction detection, or select direction manually. Pick a time or use current time, then hit ‚ÄúFind Best Side.‚Äù

### Project Documentation
For Software:
- The app uses the Geolocation API to get heading data when set to Auto direction mode.
- Time input helps simulate or select the time of day.
- Logic compares direction and time to recommend the side least exposed to sunlight.
- Responsive and accessible UI styled with CSS variables and Google Fonts.
